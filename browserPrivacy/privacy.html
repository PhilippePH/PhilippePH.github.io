  <h1>My browser privacy setup recommendation</h1>
    <p><i>Not sure why you should care yet? Check out this page: <a href="./privacyRelevance.html">The Relevance of Web Privacy for Everyday Users</a></i></p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Use a more privacy-focused browser. I currently use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. (If you use Firefox,
        disable sponsored shortcuts and sponsored stories, found in about:preferences#home (I disabled them altogether). I also disabled Snippets.)</li>
      
      <li>Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij">Ghostery</a>
        web extension. It will help block a lot of trackers, and reduce the number of annoying cookie banner.</li>
      
      <li>Install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">containers</a> extension, 
        and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-use-firefox-containers">set it up</a> according to your internet
         usage. For example, I have a container for Meta websites, Google websites, and Microsoft websites. I also have a container
         for the finance websites I use (banks), one for other social media, and one for the newsite I visit.
        This method containerizes (isolates) cookies, scripts, etc., limiting the scope trackers can use to track your browsing.
        This is also great for security reasons as malicious scripts will be limited to the container they are contained in. </li>
    
      
        <li>Change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo. For day-to-day browsing, DuckDuckGo should be satisfactory. When doing advanced research, 
          it might be useful to use Google as its search results are still better.</li>
      
      <li>Use "custom" tracking protection. Tick every box, and select "all cross-site cookies" and "in all windows" (about:preferences#privacy).
         Personally, I have found that very few websites actually break due to those hardened settings. In those rare cases, simply click the 
         Firefox lock icon in the search bar and disable enhanced protection for that one website. </li>
      
      <li>I do NOT delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed, because I have found this to be too much of a hurdle (it logs you out of every website,
          every time Firefox closes). I do however enable the functionality "Clear history when Firefox closes" as this does not impact my browsing experience 
          much.</li>
      
      <li>Refuse when websites ask to access your location, unless you judge it to be absolutely necessary</li>
    
    </ul>

      <p>These guides are intended for friends and family who may want to adapt their web setup. 
        My recommendations are not exhaustive, and might become outdated. 
        Many thanks to <a href="https://sunknudsen.com/">Sun Knudsen</a>; 
        his great Youtube channel piqued my interest concerning web privacy and security,
        and a lot of my setup is based on his.</p>

     <h3>Do you absolutely want to keep using Google Chrome?</h3>
      <p>If you absolutely want to keep using Google Chrome (which I don't recommend), then here's how you can make some improvements to your setup. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij">Ghostery</a> web extension. It will help block a lot of trackers, and reduce the number of annoying cookie banner.</li>
        <li>Disable everything in the ad menu (chrome://settings/adPrivacy)</li>
        <li>Remove "Make searches and browsing better" (chrome://settings/privacy/guide?step=msbb)</li>
        <li>Refuse when websites ask to access your location, unless you judge it to be absolutely necessary</li>
        <li>Change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo. For day-to-day browsing, DuckDuckGo should be satisfactory. When doing advanced research, it might be useful to use Google as its search results are still better.</li>
        <li>Consider using a different web browser</li>
      </ul>
