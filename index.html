  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I have recently graduated from Imperial College London (UK), a world-leading university in science and engineering, where I pursued a master's degree in computer science (MSc Computing). Through this program, I have developed a strong foundation in core and specialized computing topics while gaining hands-on practical skills. I have worked with programming languages such as C++, Python, JavaScript (and as this website clearly showcases, a strong understanding of HTML).</p>
    <p>Prior to my masters, I obtained a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) degree from McGill University's Desautels Faculty of Management (Canada), where I developed a solid foundation in business, finance, and sustainability. This multidisciplinary background equips me with a unique perspective that blends technical expertise with a deep understanding of organizational needs and challenges.</p>

  <h3>Current Projects and Interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Web privacy and security: </b>I have been interested in web privacy and security for over a year. Two resources I am very fond of are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SunKnudsen">Sun Knudsen's YouTube channel</a>, and <a href="https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html">Michael Bazzell's Privacy, Security and OSINT podcast</a>. Recently, I have also been reading up on cybersecurity and OSINT.</li>
    <li><b>ConnectED: </b>I am currently advising McGill students who are running the <a href="https://connectedmcgill.wixsite.com/connected">ConnectED initiative</a>, an initiative I created during my last year at McGill with some amazing teammates and friends. ConnectED's goal is to diversify learning opportunities by connecting university students with elementary and secondary classrooms.</li>
    <li><b>Cocktail App: </b>I find making cocktails, and understanding the different properties of different ingredients very fun. When I was starting out, I created a tool that helped me categorize cocktails and list the recipes I could make based on the ingredients I had at home. I am currently adapting this tool to create a more user friendly app that I can share with my friends. I also want to incorporate numerous features I've had in the back of my head for about two years now. For all my friends who've been waiting for this app, I appreciate your patience: It is coming... eventually!</li>
    <!-- <li><b>Varia: </b> Coffee, classical music, books (and goodreads), movies (and letterboxd), running. -->
    <li><b>Reading: </b>I allocate time for reading, tracking my progress on Goodreads. I'm pleased to have maintained an upward trend since 2019 and am determined not to break the streak this year. My favorite reads of the year (so far) are <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62814722-femme-fleuve">'Femme fleuve'</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time">'A Brief History of Time'</a>.</li>
